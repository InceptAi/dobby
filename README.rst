Dobby
=======================

A module to process the network summaries generated by the click modular router
`<http://read.cs.ucla.edu/click/click>`_. See the API documentation for more details. 
It is maintained by Vivek Shrivastava (vivek@inceptai.com).

Dobby captures and parses the low level network traces to provide insights on potential bottlenecks and spurious traffic. It analyzes packet size, source / destination IP addresses, arrival rate, application type (TCP/UDP) and many more factors to provide insights into the network. It automatically decodes your encrypted traffic if you provide it with your wireless password. You can extend it very easily to build custom monitoring applications.
